# ResNet

> ResNet practice project

1. Paper replicate, implement ResNet50
2. Use Food101 datasets to train ResNet50 model
3. Turn notebook code into python script(going modular)

## File description
* data_setup.py : Load data and process, create dataloader
* ResNet.py : Paper replicate file, replicate resnet50 model
* train.py : Function for train and evaluate model
* utils.py : Utility funcion for saving trained model
* test.py : Train resnet50 model using modular files

## Basic Project Workflow:
1. Data (prepare and load)
2. Build model
3. Fitting the model to data (training)
4. Making predictions and evaluting the model (inference)
5. Saving and loading a model
6. Putting it all together
